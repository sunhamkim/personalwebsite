    abstract: This paper explores the effect of two different types of land use policies on regional economies by using regional level data of South Korea. We analyze the effect of conventional land-use restrictions in existing cities as well as the effect of unique land-supply policies, motivated by the South Korean governmentâ€™s 2nd New Town Project which built new cities from the scratch, supplying 666,000 houses near Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). We estimate the effect of such policies on the aggregate and regional economies, considering both the efficiency gain from the resource reallocation and externalities from regional decline. If the government introduces tighter land-use restrictions in SMA and relaxes land-use restrictions in other regions, regional population will more evenly distribute at the cost of aggregate GDP loss and universal housing price increases. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the 2nd New Town Project was cost effective as it permanently increased steady state real aggregate GDP flow by 0.4%, for the one-time cost amounting 4.05% of GDP. It however exacerbated regional decline by decreasing overall rural population share by 4%.

    abstract: "Compulsory public education is a common policy tool to achieve greater participation in education, particularly from marginalized groups. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented school closures around the globe. Households seek their own mitigation strategy against education loss via private substitutes. We use the COVID-19 response of South Korea as a laboratory for investigating the effects of pandemic-induced school closure on parental investment and educational outcomes. Specifically, we exploit the school-level variations in in-person learning days driven by government and local authorities. Combining administrative data and longitudinal survey, our fixed effects regression identifies that losing 10 additional days implies a 9.5% increase in private education expenditure. In addition, we build and estimate a structural model tournament to quantify the impact of school closure on educational inequalities. A counterfactual experiment suggests that a $450 voucher for private tutoring may compensate for the test score loss caused by a 20-day loss of in-person schooling. Our results shed light on how households make schooling decisions and have implications on the longer-run educational inequality induced by the pandemic. Methodologically, we propose an estimation algorithm that tightly links the natural experiment estimates and the structural model."
